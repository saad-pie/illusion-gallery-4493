# Illusion Gallery: A Pure HTML/CSS Museum of Optical Illusions

Step into the **Illusion Gallery**, a unique web experience designed as a quirky, single-file museum built entirely with HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates the power of fundamental web technologies to create something playful and memorable, without relying on JavaScript, fancy frameworks, or heavy interactivity.

The goal is to trick your brain on purpose, showcasing how simple styling and careful layout can manipulate perception.

## Concept & Experience

The webpage opens with a bold heading: "Welcome to the Illusion Gallery," followed by a brief introduction explaining its curated, non-functional nature. Visitors will scroll through various "rooms," each featuring a classic optical illusion. Each illusion includes a short, plain-text description explaining what the viewer is supposed to see—or fail to see—providing both entertainment and education.

## Featured Illusions

The gallery will feature a selection of well-known optical illusions, including:

*   **Müller-Lyer Illusion:** Two straight lines of equal length appearing different due to arrowheads. Recreated using Unicode characters or static images.
*   **Café Wall Illusion:** Parallel lines appearing to slant due to staggered black and white tiles. Achieved using pure CSS patterns on `<div>` blocks.
*   **Rubin Vase:** A silhouette that alternates between a vase and two faces.
*   **Kanizsa Triangle:** Where the brain perceives a triangle that isn't explicitly drawn.
*   **Impossible Penrose Stairs:** An impossible object that appears to ascend or descend infinitely.

## Navigation

Navigation is intentionally simple and lightweight. A menu at the top of the page provides anchor links to different sections of the gallery, such as "Lines," "Patterns," "Shapes," and "Impossible Objects." Clicking a link instantly scrolls the user to the corresponding illusion.

## Styling & Aesthetics

The design embraces minimalism to reinforce its core concept:

*   **Background:** White or off-white.
*   **Layout:** Centered content for a focused viewing experience.
*   **Typography:** A clean serif font, reminiscent of an academic exhibition.
*   **Separation:** Subtle CSS borders and spacing to clearly delineate each illusion as a distinct exhibit.

The Illusion Gallery is a paradoxical creation—static yet playing with perception, simple yet making the brain work overtime. It stands as proof that creativity is not limited by the tools you choose not to use, demonstrating how a tiny world of wonder can be built with nothing but HTML and CSS.
